# 5th-Python-Game
I made this around 10/24/21. This is a revisit of the 4th game but optimized.
At this point I realized how bad my previous code was and knew I had to fix and then optimize the computers logic to guess the user's input in as little guesses as possible.
This time I use a system that adjusts the min and max depending on the "lower", "higher" input it gets. I also allowed it to be played for as many times as the user likes.
The code is much cleaner as well as I found out that \n is a thing and I didn't have to write a print statement on one line and a blank input statement on the one below it.
